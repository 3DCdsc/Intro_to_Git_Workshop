## Git Commands:

We will now be going over some basic git commands

### git add:

This command is used to add changes in the working directory to the staging area. It is used to tell Git that you would like to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, ```git add``` does not actually record any change until you run the ```git commit```command, which we will look into soon!!
