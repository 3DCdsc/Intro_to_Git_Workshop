## What is Git and why should I learn Git?  

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="imgs/git.png" /></div>

Git is a version control tool. It helps you to manage the project history of modern projects (usually software). It is almost always an essential tool when collaborating with others on software projects.

Modern projects are usually iteratively improved, and Git helps us to manage these small iterations efficiently and cleanly.

## What is GitHub and how is it different from Git?

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="imgs/github.png" /></div>

Github is a popular Git repository hosting service. A Git repository is a virtual Git collection, containing different versions of your project files. You can find many Git repositories on Github's website (www.github.com)

We will first start with the fundamentals of Git.

## Environment Setup (Git)

### Windows

You will need to install [Git Bash for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win). Just follow the installation instructions and choose the default settings for now.

### Mac OS X

If it is not already installed, use the following command in Terminal

```terminal
brew install git
```

### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

If it is not already installed, use the following command in bash

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

### Linux (Fedora)

If it is not already installed, use the following command in bash

```bash
sudo yum install git
```
