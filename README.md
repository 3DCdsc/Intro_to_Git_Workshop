Git is a version control tool. It helps you to manage the project history of modern projects (usually software). It is almost always an essential tool when collaborating with others on software projects.

Modern projects are usually iteratively improved, and Git helps us to manage these small iterations efficiently and cleanly.

Github is a popular Git repository hosting service. A Git repository is a virtual Git collection, containing different versions of your project files. You can find many Git repositories on Github's website (www.github.com)

We will first start with the fundamentals of Git.
